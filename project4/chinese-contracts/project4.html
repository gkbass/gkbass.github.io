            <p align="justify"><b>PART TWO | A Visualization of China's Use of Soft Power Around the World </b></p>

            <p align="justify">China's use of soft power poses a threat to United States foreign policy interests around the world. In 2018 the U.S. Intelligence Community identified China as a potential threat to the United States in their <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/2019-ATA-SFR---SSCI.pdf">Worldwide Threat Assessment</a>.</p>

            <p align="justify"><b>Economic Incentives</b>: China will also pursue efforts aimed at fulfilling its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative to expand China’s economic reach and political influence across Eurasia, Africa, and the Pacific through infrastructure projects (Director of National Intelligence, 2018, p. 18).
            </p>

            <p><b>CHINESE INVESTMENT IN AFRICA</b></p>

            <p align="justify"> To understand Chinese efforts at “fulfilling its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative to expand economic reach and political influence” (Director of National Intelligence, 2018, p. 18) we analyze Chinese investment in Africa. The Belt and Road Initiative spans across the world, but China has heavily invested in infrastructure and agriculture projects across Africa. The China Africa Research Initiative (SAIS-CARI) at John Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies “examines China-Africa relations through a rigorous mixed methodology approach, combining quantitative and qualitative methods.” From extensive data on Chinese foreign direct investment, private Chinese loans, Chinese agricultural investments, Chinese-Africa construction contracts, and the numbers of Chinese workers in African countries — SAIS-CARI collects and presents data from a variety of published government databases. China has used soft power to influence all domains of the African economy. The interactive map displays two sets of data: Chinese agricultural investment and 2018 Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Africa. Agricultural investment is categorized by country, farm name, reported farm location, reported Chinese investor, and planted crops. Chinese FDI stock in Africa has been invested into the following top five sectors: construction, mining, manufacturing, financial intermediation, and information transmission/computer services and software. Total Chinese FDI stock has exponentially increased since 2002, while a comparison of Chinese and United States annual import/export trade with Africa has significantly differed. An in-depth study of China’s financial investment in Africa shows China’s economic reach and political influence runs deeper than foreign direct investment.</p>

            <p><b>Section One | Chinese Agricultural Investments &amp; Chinese Foreign Direct Investment in Africa </b></p>

            <p align="justify"><i>The following data is from CARI's <a href="http://www.sais-cari.org/data-chinese-agricultural-investments-in-africa">Chinese Agricultural Investements in Africa</a> and <a href="http://www.sais-cari.org/chinese-investment-in-africa"> Chinese Investment in Africa</a>. FDI data is sourced from the 2007 China Statistical Yearbook, the Statical Bulletin of China's Outward Foreign Direct Investment, and the China Commerce Yearbooks. Data on agricultural investments was compiled by CARI fieldwork, interviews, and desk studies with the website citing that CARI "now partners with the Land Matrix in helping them verify cases of Chinese agricultural investment" (SAIS-CARI).</i></p>

            <p align="justify">To navigate the interactive map, hover over countries in purple to view information on: Country, Farm Name, Reported Farm Location, Reported Chinese Investor, and Planted Crops. At the top left of the map, check<i>2017 Chinese FDI Stock in Africa</i> and uncheck <i>Chinese Agricultural Investments</i>. The darker the country the greater the Chinese FDI.

            <p align="justify"><b>Chinese Agricultural Investments: </b>In China’s Belt and Road Initiative a national food security strategy was defined for China to utilize labor resources to develop foreign land, water, and energy resources. Rice, grain, and rubber were the most reported planted crops between 2010 and 2017. Cameroon alone, accounted for 41% of all the land actually acquired by the Chinese (SAIS-CARI). CARI Director Deborah Brautigam’s writes if the “Chinese government is aggressively buying huge tracts of prime African land to grow food to ship back to China” Will Africa Feed China? in the future? Africa is a developing continent with an abundance of arable farmland and Chinese investors CITIC Construction and CAMC Engineering were the largest recorded investor in Angola between 2011 and 2014. Specifically GMG Global/Sinochem acquired the most land in Africa to grow rubber. China recognizes the advantages to investing in agricultural projects in Africa and it is our responsibility to be aware of the reasons.	</p>

            <p align="justify"> <br>
                <b>Chinese Foreign Direct Investments:</b> Chinese direct investment in Africa grew at an annual rate of 20.5% with the top 7 African destinations of FDI as Algeria, South Africa, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, Nigeria, Angola, and Ethiopia (SAIS-CARI). Chinese FDI steadily increased between 2003 and 2017, from 631 million in 2003 to 3 billion in 2015. Global foreign aid expenditure has also increased with total global FDI stock in 2017 at 1,809 billion USD. While Chinese FDI flow to Africa has remained between two and four billion unadjusted USD — since 2009, the United States FDI flow to Africa has significantly decreased. At the peak in 2009, U.S. FDI flow to Africa was almost 10 billion unadjusted USD. A steady decrease in FDI flow since 2009 has reduced U.S. FDI flow to 0.332 billion USD in 2017. It is important to note that Chinese FDI data is “overestimated by others and [...] the numbers are also understated because they do not include Chinese money that is parked in an offshore financial center (British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Hong Kong), they do not capture smaller investors, and they do not record acquisitions that include African assets, but that took place in another jurisdiction” (SAIS-CARI). Although there is ambiguity in the FDI flow estimates, it is undeniable that Chinese global foreign aid expenditure and total Chinese FDI stock in African countries has significantly increased since the Belt and Road Initiative was launched.</p>

            <p align="justify">In 2017, Asian and Africa were the largest source of gross annual revenue for Chinese construction projects globally. With Asia bringing in 52.4% of revenue and Africa at 30.4%, these projects mainly include the construction of fiber optic cables, renewable energy power plants, and transportation infrastructure (SAIS-CARI). Five of the largest Chinese construction contracts are in Algeria, Angola, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Nigeria. According to SAIS- CARI research, “these five countries account for 54% of all Chinese companies’ 2017 construction project gross annual revenues in Africa, [with] Algeria alone account[ing] for 15%.” Along with Chinese companies investing in Africa, an opportunity has arisen for Chinese workers to earn money in Africa. At the end of 2017 there were 202,689 Chinese workers in Africa, a decrease since 2016. Included in the statistics are “Chinese workers sent to work on Chinese companies’ construction projects and Chinese workers sent to work for non-Chinese companies in Africa” (SAIS-CARI). An article by Quartz depicts a continent where <i>Africa is changing China as much as China is changing Africa</i>. From “Chinese electronics, clothing, and beauty products flooding local markets”, an influx of African exchange students studying at Chinese universities, and “thousands of African officials and politicians being hosted in China by the Communist Party and other government ministries” (Kuo, 2018) — China’s culture is influencing communities in Africa. China’s expanding soft power influence in the developing world will forge new relationships and alter the political-geographical landscape.

            <p align="justify">The relationships China is building with African countries and communities is strategic and calculated. From agricultural investments in rice and soybean crops, an action that in the future could provide food security for mainland China, to investments in infrastructure projects — these activities bolster China’s political influence. The Chinese workers, investors, and entrepreneurs integrating themselves into African communities not only provide opportunities for development but promote “a good Chinese narrative, and better communications China’s messages to the world” (Albert, 2018) through the establishment of Chinese culture and language. But hidden beneath the surface of Chinese investment many African communities experience racial discrimination, segregation, and resentment from Chinese workers on the Chinese-led construction projects and in the community. Is China influence Africa through the use of soft power, a beneficial opportunity for development or a new system of colonialism?</p>
